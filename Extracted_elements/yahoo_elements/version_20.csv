Speaking from Windsor, a visibly-excited Prince Harry shared his immense pride as he joked of getting just two hours' sleep, calling the birth 'the most amazing experience I could ever have possibly imagined'.

An overjoyed Prince Harry said: 'Mother and baby are doing incredibly well. It's been amazing, so we just wanted to share this with everybody.'

I have flown many transport missions from Guantanamo and NAS Jacksonville (C9 or DC9).  The wire that they are talking about is an arresting gear cable that can be used for carrier type aircraft with a tail hook.  In most cases, the cable does not pose a problem for landing aircraft.  As a civilian B737 captain, I have thousands of hours in this particular 737-800 model.  The plane can be a handful or difficult to fly for inexperienced pilots.  I have flown this plane into the shortest runways allowed for this airplane (About 5,000 feet).  The star feature of the -800 are its strong carbon brakes.  Under dry light wind conditions, the plane can stop on a dime without the use of reverse thrust.  One would use full flaps (40 degrees) and fly right on the calculated approach speed.  I routinely flew flights into places like Jackson Hole, John Wayne / O.C. Airport, small islands in the Pacific, etc., at night and in bad weather.  If the weather is poor and there is a slippery runway, then they should not have dispatched into a short runway with no reverse thrust.  This was not considered a ""short runway"" (7800 feet).  It is my guess that they landed using normal 30 degree flaps and were probably high and fast.  Who ever was flying saw that they were high, s/he chopped the power, dove for the runway and ran out of speed. That's why they bounced.  The B737-800 has a fairly high incidence of tail strikes if they are not flying right on speed and get slow.  It is my guess that they touched down about half way down the runway or more.  If the RW was wet, they probably hydroplaned.  Like I said, the brakes are great in this plane but do you no good if they are hydroplaning.  Using one R/T while hydroplaning can cause loss of control of the airplane.  // No Air-conditioning tells me that they dispatched with the a/c packs off.  They must have flown at or below 10,000 feet for the entire way (?).  The packs were out.  The T/R was out.  That also tells me that the plane was a mess.  Here's a dirty secret.  Many airlines can't spare a good plane for charter flights.  They often use hangar queens or planes needing maintenance.  These charter outfits often have minimum maintenance and poorly qualified crews.  Think about it.  Why would you fly a B737-800 for peanuts when you can make big bucks flying for a major airline?  The reason these people fly for these cheap outfits is because they don't meet the basic qualifications of a major airline.  I.E., something is wrong with them.  Remember, the FAA provides MINIMUM standards.  Just because a plane and or crew is FAA qualified means squat.  It means that they meet minimum standards and that's it.  

Just from the little that I know, I can pretty much guess that this was pilot error.  They are fortunate that no human was killed because they would probably be facing legal charges.  Both the charter company and the pilot(s) are going to be in BIG trouble here.  

FYI.  I have been flying all sorts of aircraft for near 49 years with no accidents, incidents or failed check rides.  I have a perfect flying record with over 25,000 hours of flying time.
